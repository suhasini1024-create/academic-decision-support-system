# academic-decision-support-system
A Java-based academic decision support system built incrementally with rule-based logic, persistence, reporting, and ML-assisted analytics.
# Academic Decision Support System

A Java-based academic decision support system designed to assist mentors in identifying
students who may require academic guidance.

## Project Status
🚧 In Progress – Phase 1 (Menu-driven CLI)

## Project Vision
This project is being developed incrementally to simulate an industry-style
software development process. The system will evolve through multiple phases,
including decision logic, persistence, reporting, and ML-assisted analytics.

## Planned Phases
- Phase 1: Menu-driven CLI and core decision engine
- Phase 2: Persistence layer and mentor workflows
- Phase 3: Explainable rule engine and reporting
- Phase 4: ML-assisted academic risk analysis

## Tech Stack
- Java (Core)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Git & GitHub
- Python (for ML extension – later phase)
